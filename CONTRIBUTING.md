## Code Style

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the code, please run `pnpm format` to format the code. And we also have some other rules:

- Do not use specifiers for `fs` and `path` modules.
- Do use `pathe` instead of `path` module for windows compatibility.

```ts
// bad
import { writeFile } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';

// good
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'pathe';
```

- Do use `test()` instead of `describe` + `it()` for test cases.

```ts
// bad
describe('test', () => {
  it('test', () => {});
});

// good
test('test', () => {});
```

- Api, commands and config in README.md should be ordered alphabetically.

```ts
// bad
- `tnf foo`
- `tnf bar`

// good
- `tnf bar`
- `tnf foo`
```
